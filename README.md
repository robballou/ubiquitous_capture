# Ubiquitous Capture

To capture, collect, and share miscellany.

## General background

The idea of this project to create a server and components that will allow people to capture information from a variety of sources and use it in a way that helps them do things. Not very concrete, right?

First, let's look at collecting information... that might include things like:

- Social media messages (tweets, instragram, flickr, etc.)
- Links shared to services like pinboard or tracked directly
- Commits to public and private repos or other contribution tracking
- And also "arbitrary" data. Maybe home automation, other miscellaneous data.

Collecting the data stores it and exposes it to a storage plugin system. Perhaps some of the messages and filtered into date/time silos as well as stored in a more message based format.

Then create an API to make this shareable and usable in a variety of ways. Create visualizations or boil it down into a feed.
